    <h1>FRIED EGGS WITH TOAST</h1>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 or two slices of bread</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>heat some butter on pan to coat pan, low heat</li>
        <li>if scrambled eggs are desired, crack eggs in container, add a small amount of water, and beat thoroughly</li>
        <li>bread goes in the toaster sometime around here, the timing is tricky</li>
        <li>get egg guts on pan, turn up heat</li>
        <li>eggs will cook, prepare any additional food and watch toast</l1>
        <li>when eggs start to become solid, i can use a spatula to move stuff around, if eggs aren't beet or an omelet effect is desired, I can flip the eggs in the pan</li>
        <li>as eggs start to finish i can add my cheese, and check my toast</li>
        <li>turn off heat when eggs aren't gross, keep in pan while toast finishes</li>
        <li>when toast is done, butter the toast, then pour cooked eggs onto toast for maximum enjoyment</li>
    </ol>
